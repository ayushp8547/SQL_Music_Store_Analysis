Project Summary:

This project consists of a comprehensive collection of SQL queries designed for a music store database categorized into three sets: Easy, Moderate, and Advance. These queries are designed to be used
in conjunction with a specific database schema and dataset, which will be provided alongside the project however, it can be altered for any other database and schema.

Easy Set: This set includes straightforward queries aimed at basic data retrieval and simple analyses. Tasks covered include identifying senior employees, analyzing invoice data, determining top 
customers, and finding the highest revenue-generating city.

Moderate Set: Queries in this set are more complex and delve deeper into database querying. Tasks include identifying customers who listen to rock music, finding top rock bands, and filtering tracks
based on song length.

Advance Set: The advanced queries tackle intricate analyses, such as determining the amount spent by each customer on specific artists and identifying the most popular music genres for each country.

The provided SQL queries are thoroughly commented for clarity and understanding. Users are required to upload the provided database schema and dataset to their database management system before 
executing the queries. This project serves as a valuable resource for educational purposes, database exploration, and as reference material for database-related projects.
